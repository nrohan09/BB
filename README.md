# Battle Buddy Documentation

**INTRODUCTION:**

Ever played a combat game and got killed by an enemy who attacked from behind? Wished you had a pair of eyes behind you in that situation? While shooting games are fun and all, in real life, this is a for more grave concern. Enemies who use stealth, sneak up behind an unsuspecting victim, and thrust a knife into their throat, giving them no chance to fight back. Even armed enemies could shoot from back. The human field of view is small we miss things behind us, to the sides of us, and above us. This is a constraint on our ability to perceive things around us.

Not just this. The Army in general has not benefited much from the recent advancements in technology. In India at least this seems to be the case. We appear to be using the decades old World War I technology.

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

Battle Buddy is a kind of helmet that is boon for soldiers. **If some enemy tries to approach them from behind, or aims a gun at them, this will automatically be detected(by image processing, ML) via a camera and the soldier will be alerted by a mild alarm, audible only to the soldier.** In this way, the life of the soldier would be saved.

**ABOUT THE MODEL:**  A Camera attached to a helmet is the most basic idea of the model. The Camera would be connected to a computer which would receive the footage from the camera and keep processing it continuosly.
